# SK Dispatch

This compact REST API and [Uplink](https://github.com/SVKruik-Organization/Uplink) consumer makes sending mails consistent and a breeze. Instead of all the SK Platform apps having their own approach and nuances in styling, Dispatch consolidates it into one API. Just send the filename and its replacement variables and the mail is *dispatch*ed.

Because a simple `README.md` can only do so much, I have also made an documentation platform, [SK Docs](https://platform.stefankruik.com/documentation). If you are serious about using my products, I highly recommend reading the relevant articles. Don't have time for that? Don't hesitate to [reach out](https://skpvt.io/r/support). I am always open to have a chat and answer questions to your heart's content, unless I am debugging deployment 😄.
