Making dispatching mails a breeze. Simplifies communication with SK Dispatch for other apps by removing boilerplate and providing stronger Intellisense.

This package is developed along-side the [server](https://github.com/SVKruik-Organization/Dispatch/tree/main/server) for tight typings and validations.

Because a simple `README.md` can only do so much, I have also made an documentation platform, [SK Docs](https://platform.stefankruik.com/documentation). If you are serious about using my products, I highly recommend reading the relevant articles. Don't have time for that? Don't hesitate to [reach out](https://skpvt.io/r/support). I am always open to have a chat and answer questions to your heart's content, unless I am debugging deployment 😄.
